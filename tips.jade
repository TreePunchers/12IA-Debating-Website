      h2 The Moot
      p
         | The moot is the motion of the debate. It is a statement, idea or policy that each team is either arguing for, or against. There are two main types of moots, each of which must be taken with a different approach - change, or judgment debates.
      p
         strong Change Debate
         br
         | These debates are ones in which some action must take place in order to solve a problem. Change debates need a model, that is, a precise way in which this change would be carried out. Make sure to cover who would enforce this, who would pay for it, and any other specifics depending on the case.
      p
         strong Judgment Debate
         br
         | These debates are ones in which philosophies are compared. This does not require a model, but should instead be a weighing up of ideas and opinions, backed up by fact.

                     br
                     | A first speaker, needs to introduce their team members, and their points.  A good hook is also important, going straight into a boring introduction is not the best thing to do. A short, snappy phrase that sums up their team's case is good for this. Additionally they will need to

                     br
                     | In a change debate, the affirmative first speaker needs to provide a model, explained above. The negative first speaker may, and probably should, point out flaws in the affirmative team's model.

                     br
                     | Only the first negative can do rebuttal (as the first affirmative hasn't heard anyone talk yet). This should be kept brief as the first speaker needs to spend a lot of time on the teams main points.

                     strong Substantive Points
                     br
                     | The most important thing in any debate are the arguments. The first speaker should bring out the main and key points and develop them as well as possible. This is essential for a team's case to be persuasive, and is the bulk of the first speaker's time spent.

                     br
                     | A brief recap of a first speaker's substantive points is a useful summary. At the end of any speaker's speech, it is generally customary to say some variation of the moot stands/falls, depending on which side of the argument they are on.

                     br
                     | A second speaker needs only to introduce their points, but they should use a good hook similarly to the first speaker as well (the same line throughout will help with teamwork points).
                  p
                     strong Rebuttal
                     br
                     | The second speaker is the first chance for some proper rebuttal. A little less than half of the speech should be rebuttal. Attacking any flaws in the opposing teams arguments in the order they were brought up is probably the easiest way to achieve this.
                  p
                     strong Substantive Points
                     br
                     | Substantive points are also very important for the second speaker. Anything not covered in the first speaker's speech should be covered in depth here. A second speaker's substantive points should focus on some additional, but alternate approaches to the first speaker, although some overlap (and extension) can also be done.
                  p
                     strong Conclusion
                     br
                     | Similarly to the first speaker, a conclusion should summarise the second speaker's substantive points, and state that the moot stands/falls.

                     br
                     | A third speaker's introduction should be a continuation of the team's hook, as well as a split of the main points of the debate so far. This is generally done in the format of "I think this debate has come down to 2-3 main points of clash," followed by a list of these points.
                  p
                     strong Rebuttal
                     br
                     | Rebuttal should, if possible, be grouped within these main points. A third speaker's entire speech is rebuttal, and so a fair amount of detail should go into this. See the rebuttal section for more details. A third speaker should not bring up any substantive points at all during their speech, they will be discounted, as there is not enough time to respond to them adequately.
                  p
                     strong Conclusion
                     br
                     | A good summary for a third speaker would be a brief recap of the main points, and how your team has shown they are right on them.

                     | A leader's reply is generally done by the first speaker of a team, although it may, rarely, be the second. This is a short recap of the debate, in a similar style to a third speaker, by discussing the main points and importantly why their team has won each of these points.

      h2 Developing Points
      p
         | Depth and quantity of argument is key in debating. It is important to look at as many perspectives as possible, and also over many time scales, from immediate to very long term. Good view points are not only all obviously affected groups, but also the broader effects on economic, social, environmental and political situations. This will increase the depth of points, and in turn, gain you more points. The best time to do this is in the 
         +tool-tip("generally teams get half an hour to prepare before a debate") prep room.

      h2 Signposting

         | It is hard to follow an unlabeled and confusing argument. By explicitly stating that you are moving onto your first substantive point, or moving onto rebuttal, it makes it very clear for the

         |   should, in a similar way to how points are developed, be developed as in depth as possible. Consider all relevant viewpoints and time scales. It is important to reference the opponent who said what you are rebutting against, but do not speak to the person, speak to the adjudicator.

         |  you may choose to accept it or decline it before the question is asked. When answering a POI, be sure not to talk to the opposing team, instead give your answer to the adjudicator. Also, don't be scared to stop and think for a moment before answering.

         | Having a consistent argument throughout is basic, and essential. A catch phrase or team line is a simple way to gain teamwork points. Referring to what other speakers on your team has said (e.g. 'as my first speaker said') is also another simple way to make your team's argument more cohesive.

      h2 Manner of Speaking and Body Language
      p
         | It is never a good idea to talk at the opposing team. Your discussion and argument is focused on the adjudicator and the adjudicator alone. Eye contact is a good thing as well. Some hand motions should be used for clarity, but excessive movement may be distracting for an adjudicator.
