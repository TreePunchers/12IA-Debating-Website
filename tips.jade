                     | A first speaker, needs to introduce their team members, and their points.  A good hook is also important, going straight into a boring introduction is not the best thing to do. A short, snappy phrase that sums up their team's case is good for this. Additionally they may want to define the moot.

                     br
                     | In a change debate, the affirmative first speaker needs to provide a model, that is, a precise way in which this change would be carried out - make sure to cover who would enforce this, who would pay for it, and other specifics depending on the case. The negative first speaker may, and probably should, point out flaws in the affirmative team's model.

                     br
                     | Only the first negative can do rebuttal (as the first affirmative hasn't heard anyone talk yet). This should be kept brief as the first speaker needs to spend a lot of time on the teams main points.
                  p
                     strong Substantive Points
                     br
                     | The most important thing in any debate are the arguments. The first speaker should bring out the main and key points and develop them as well as possible. This is essential for a team's case to be persuasive, and is the bulk of the first speaker's time spent.
                  p
                     strong Conclusion
                     br
                     | A brief recap of a first speaker's substantive points is a useful summary. At the end of any speaker's speech, it is generally customary to say some variation of the moot stands/falls, depending on which side of the argument they are on.

                     br
                     | A second speaker needs only to introduce their points, but they should use a good hook similarly to the first speaker as well (the same line throughout will help with teamwork points).

                     strong Rebuttal
                     br
                     | The second speaker is the first chance for some proper rebuttal. A little less than half of the speech should be rebuttal.
